Source: [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

See [codebook](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data#usa-daily-state-reports-csse_covid_19_daily_reports_us) for definition of measures. 

* <b>Confirmed</b> - Aggregated case count for the state.
* <b>Incident_Rate</b> - cases per 100,000 persons.

* <b>Deaths</b> - Aggregated death toll for the state.
* <b>Mortality_Rate</b> - Number recorded deaths * 100/ Number confirmed cases.

* <b>People_Tested</b> - Total number of people who have been tested.
* <b>Testing_Rate</b> - Total test results per 100,000 persons. The "total test results" are equal to "Total test results (Positive + Negative)" from [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/).

* <b>People_Hospitalized</b> - Total number of people hospitalized. (Nullified on Aug 31, see [Issue #3083](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/issues/3083))
* <b>Hospitalization_Rate</b> - US Hospitalization Rate (%): = Total number hospitalized / Number cases. The "Total number hospitalized" is the "Hospitalized â€“ Cumulative" count from [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/). The "hospitalization rate" and "Total number hospitalized" is only presented for those states which provide cumulative hospital data. (Nullified on Aug 31, see 

* <b>Recovered</b> - Aggregated Recovered case count for the state.
* <b>Active</b> - Aggregated confirmed cases that have not been resolved (Active cases = total cases - total recovered - total deaths).
