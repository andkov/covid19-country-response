# Data Sources 

- Cases and mortlaity for COVID-19 are sourced from the [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19-pandemic) 
- Government Response metric to COVID-19 (Stringency Index) is sources from [Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker)

___Common legend___:  

- (first dot) = 1st confirmed case
- (second dot) = 1st confirmed death  
- (dotted line) = pandemic announced by WHO (March 11)  
- (dashed lines) = 75th and 100th day since Exodus (January 13), first confirmed case outside China  
- X-asis measures `Days since Exodus`
